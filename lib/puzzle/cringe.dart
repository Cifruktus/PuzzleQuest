const String intro = """
While walking along the shore, you noticed a strange object laying on the ground. 

When you got closer it became clear that it's some kind of toy. It seemed like a simple 15-puzzle, but it looked expensive as if it was made out of gemstones. You decided to take it with you.

There is still time before you need to start heading back. Maybe we could try to solve it?

For a second everything went black. The feeling of confusion and disorientation vanished as quickly as it appeared. After a couple of seconds vision became clear again.

Wait what? What just happened?

Where am I? This place looks different.

The puzzle-toy was glowing a little in your hand. Maybe this puzzle is something more than just a toy? Is it the reason why I am here? If so, maybe another combination could take me back? Letâ€™s try to solve the puzzle in the
opposite way.
""";

const String secondSolve = """
Well, it worked. Not exactly as intended though. There might be another combination that would work better.
""";

const String solveTheSame = """
Hmm, now I'm at exact same place as before... Maybe try to solve the puzzle in another way?
""";

const String solvePrevious = """
Seems like I was here before. Well, now we know, that every combination is related to a specific place somehow.
""";

const String ending = """
This place doesn't look familiar, but I know it is Earth! 

Accidentally puzzle slipped off your hands and fell to the ground braking to the tiniest pieces. You tried to pick up some of the shards, but they all just turned to the finest dust.


Anyway, now there are more important things to do, find the way back home.
""";

const String fromStartToEnd = """
Something weird just happened, you teleported to another place on Earth.

Is this puzzle can move you anywhere on the planet? You felt that it wasn't exactly true. This thing was capable of much more. 

You felt a little disappointed that you entered this exact combination. Nothing new happened, story ended here anyway.
