const String intro = """
Walking along the shore, you've noticed a strange object laying on the ground. 

When you got closer it became clear that it's some toy. It seemed like a simple 15-puzzle, but It looked really expensive as if it was made out of gemstones. You decided to take it with you.

While there is still some time before going back, maybe try to solve it?

const String firstSolve = """
For a second everything went black. Feeling of weightless disappeared as quickly as it emerged. After a couple of seconds vision became clear again.

What? What just happened?  

Where am I? This place looks different..

The puzzle-toy was glowing a little in your hand. Maybe this puzzle is something more than just a toy?  Is it a reason why I'm here? If so, maybe another combination could bring me back? Maybe try to solve it in the **opposite way**?
""";

const String secondSolve = """
Well, it worked. Not exactly as intended though. Maybe another combination would work better?
""";

const String solveTheSame = """
Hmm, now I'm at exact same place as before.. Maybe try to solve the puzzle some other way?
""";

const String solvePrevious = """
Seems like I was there before. Well, now we know, that every combination related to a specific place somehow
""";

const String ending = """
This place doesn't look exactly familiar but it's definitely Earth!

Accidentally puzzle slipped off your hands and fell to the ground braking to the tiniest pieces. You tried to pick up some of the shards, but they all just turned to the finest dust.

Seems all the evidence of this journey just vanished. Who would ever believe in this story? 

Anyway, now there are more important things to do, find the way back home.
""";

const String fromStartToEnd = """
Something weird just happened, you teleported to another place on Earth.

Is this thing can move you anywhere on the planet? You felt that it wasn't exactly true. This puzzle was capable of much more. 

You felt a little disappointed that you entered this exact combination. Nothing new happened, story ended here anyway.
